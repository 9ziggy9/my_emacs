* My personal emacs configuration

** INSTALLATION
#+NAME: install
#+BEGIN_SRC
mkdir ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/9ziggy9/my_emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

** NOTES
*** I use Nerd Fonts, visit their repo for installation directions, or simply change font choice in init.el.
*** In order to use LSP mode with React/JSX projects, be sure to npm install eslint in the project root directory.
*** In case a project is ever blacklisted, you will want to run the following
#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x lsp-workspace-blacklist-remove
#+END_SRC

   SystemCrafter videos, obviously, some code stolen from Tsoding Daily. Helpful config walkthrough, where I stole web dev stuff:
